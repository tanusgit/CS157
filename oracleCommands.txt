docker ps 
sudo docker run -d -p 1521:1521 epiclabs/docker-oracle-xe-11g
we will get a sha key 
sudo docker exec -it 3a96e607dc39dbc9209ce5766a0b7a32cf2bd0088aa9ec85b103c12af8bee0aa /bin/bash 
sha key always changes 
3a96e607dc39dbc9209ce5766a0b7a32cf2bd0088aa9ec85b103c12af8bee0aa this is the sha key. Replace this key with the new sha key
then run sqlplus system/oracle@//localhost:1521/xe

there is only one database in oracle
